Google Contacts Map.

by Adrian Jongenelen.

Quickly evaluates distance when travelling between 2 or more addresses stored in contacts.


The idea for this project came about when Claire (my wife) started her small business, Claire's Pet Care NZ.  She uses the private vehicle for business purposes, and needs distance travelled for working out mileage expenses.  The easiest way to do this is to use Google Maps to plot the route she takes, and give the distance of the route.  She commonly visits multiple clients in a single trip, so it was important to be able to include more than 2 destinations.

Yes, I know that the google maps website already allows for this sort of thing, but as far as I could tell you couldn't just type in a contact's name and get it to send you there.  The Maps app on the iPhone also has a feature like this that links to your contacts, but it's limited to only 2 end points.  This application is kind of mixture of both.
